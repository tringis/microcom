.SH NAME
microcom \- Simple serial port terminal program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B microcom
.BI [ options ]
.BI < device >
.BI [ cmd ]
.B ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B microcom
is a simple serial port connection tool. It does not implement
terminal emulation or special modem support, but is very efficiant
when you need a serial connection to a device connected to the serial
port. It can either be run interactively, or it can run an program
with the standard input and output of that program connected to the
serial port.
.LP
The program will run until it is terminated by the user by
SIGINT. This is normally done by pressing control-C.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-b \fIbaud\fR, --baud=\fIbaud"
Set the baud rate. The default is 115200 baud.
.IP "-f \fIformat\fR, --format=\fIformat"
Set the line format. The format is specified by a three character
string, where the first character determines the parity, the second
determines the number of data bits, and the third determines the
number of stop bits. The parity character is
.B E
for even parity,
.B O
for odd parity, and
.B N
for no parity. The default format is
.BR N81 .
.IP "-F mode, --flow-control=mode"
Configure flow control. The mode is one of
.B
none
for no flow control,
.B ctsrts
for CTS/RTS flow control,
.B xonxoff
for XON/XOFF flow control, or
.B both
for both CTS/RTS and XON/XOFF flow control.  The default mode is
.BR ctsrts .
.IP "--flush"
Flush I/O at program start.
.IP "-h, --help"
Print a summary of the command-line options on the standard output and
exit.
.IP "-L, --local-echo"
Enable local echo.
.IP "-l \fIfile\fR, --log=\fIfile\fR"
Log input communication to file.
.IP "-V, --version"
Display the
.B microcom
version on standard output and exit.
.SH EXAMPLES
To connect to /dev/ttyS0 at 115200 baud with CTS/RTS flow control:
.IP
microcom /dev/ttyS0
.LP
To connect to /dev/ttyS0 at 9600 baud with no flow control:
.IP
microcom -b 9600 -F none /dev/ttyS0
.LP
To send the file foo.bar on the serial port at 38400 baud:
.IP
microcom -b 38400 /dev/ttyS0 cat foo.bar
.LP
This works since the standard output of the
.I cat
command is connected to the serial port. The standard input of the
command is also connected, but it is not used in this example.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
All commands will hopefully generate meaningful error messages on all
possible errors.
.SH BUGS
To be discovered...
